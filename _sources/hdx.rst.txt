HDX/MS
======

Hydrogen exchange with mass spectrometry (HX/MS) measures
the rate of exchange of labile hydrogen atoms with deuterium 
in a protein's backbone amide groups to report on structural 
changes in protein ensembles but at the peptide level, not individual amino acids.
With the advent of integrated robotics for automated sample preparation
and accurate protein structure prediction methods
for improved data interpretation, HX/MS is an increasingly 
powerful method for probing solution-state protein ensembles. 
However, the technique is not used to its full potential due to 
its peptide resolution.

To address this problem, we developed **PIGEON-FEATHER** (Peptide ID Generation 
for Exchange Of Nuclei-Free Energy Assignment Through Hydrogen Exchange Rates): 
an HX/MS analysis method to calculate the absolute free energy of opening (âˆ†Gop) 
for almost all the amino acids in a protein ensemble.
